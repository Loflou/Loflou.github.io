<div><p>Bizarre Connection Between a Train Derailment and a Movie: Ohio Incident Repeats White Noise Plot</p></div>
<div><p>Residents of East Palestine, Ohio were in shock on Monday after a train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed and leaked toxic substances into the air, forcing the evacuation of several neighborhoods. The incident occurred in a town that appears in the 2022 movie White Noise, which features a train derailment that triggers a similar environmental disaster.</p></div>
<div><p>In the film, the Airborne Toxic Event leaks into the air after a train crash that happens in East Palestine, where the movie was filmed. White Noise hit the screens on August 31, 2022, just months before the real-life incident that took place on February 13, 2023.</p></div>
<div><p>The bizarre coincidence has sparked suspicions that the movie was an act of "predictive programming" aimed at preparing the public for the event. In a video posted on his YouTube channel, Decoding with Cody, Cody analyzes the film"s plot and connections to the Ohio incident.</p></div>
<div><p>According to Cody, the movie"s characters" obsession with Hitler and Elvis and the references to death are significant. In the film, Jack Gladney, a professor of Hitler studies, is afraid of death and becomes increasingly paranoid about his mortality. His colleague, Murray Jay Siskind, is obsessed with Elvis Presley, and their conversations revolve around their idols" relationships with their mothers.</p></div>
<div><p>Cody argues that in Gematria, a numerological system used in Jewish Kabbalistic studies, the words "death" and "Adolf" (Hitler"s first name) have the same numerical value (38, 20, and 97). Thus, Jack"s fixation on Hitler, whose name is connected to death, reflects his fear of dying.</p></div>
<div><p>The film"s climax, where the train carrying toxic chemicals crashes, occurs during a lecture about Elvis"s mother and Hitler"s bond with his mother. As the characters discuss the word "death," the truck driver listening to Elvis crashes into the train, releasing the chemicals into the air.</p></div>
<div><p>While the connection between the movie and the Ohio incident could be coincidental, some are convinced that the film"s plot and references to Hitler and Elvis were deliberate. Cody and others argue that "predictive programming" in films and media is a tactic used by the elite to prepare the public for future events. The Ohio incident, they believe, is just one example of this.</p></div>
<div><p>The White Noise incident in Ohio is still under investigation, and authorities are urging residents to remain cautious and follow safety procedures. The town has suffered a significant environmental impact, and many residents are expressing their frustration at the possible links between the incident and the movie.</p></div>
